# Best Practices Issues & Fixes

Not sure why your Best Practices score dropped? This page covers every audit with links to detailed fix guides.

Best Practices audits are binary—pass or fail. No thresholds, no partial credit. The good news: fixes are usually straightforward once you identify the problem.

## Diagnose Your Issue

**Quick check with Chrome DevTools:**

1. Open DevTools → **Console** tab
2. Look for red error messages (this fails the console errors audit)
3. Switch to **Issues** tab for browser-detected problems
4. Run Lighthouse from the **Lighthouse** tab
5. Check which specific audits failed

**What Lighthouse tells you:**

Unlike Performance audits with suggestions and estimates, Best Practices audits show exactly what failed. Console errors list the actual errors. Deprecated API usage shows which APIs. Permission prompts identify the specific permission.

## Decision Tree

Work through this to find your issue:

1. **Check HTTPS first.** Are you on HTTP? → [Fix HTTPS](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/is-on-https)
2. **HTTP→HTTPS redirect working?** Visit HTTP version → [Fix redirect](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/redirects-http)
3. **Any console errors?** Open DevTools Console → [Fix errors](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/errors-in-console)
4. **Permission prompts on load?** Watch for geolocation/notification dialogs → [Fix permissions](#permission-audits)
5. **Images look wrong?** Blurry or distorted images → [Fix sizing](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/image-size-responsive) or [ratios](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/image-aspect-ratio)
6. **Back button slow?** Check bfcache eligibility → [Fix bfcache](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/bf-cache)
7. **DevTools Issues tab warnings?** → [Fix inspector issues](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/inspector-issues)

## All Audits by Priority

### Critical - Fix Immediately

These failures indicate fundamental problems that affect security or core functionality.

#### [Uses HTTPS](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/is-on-https)

**What it checks:** Page served over secure HTTPS connection.

**Why it's critical:** HTTP pages are flagged "Not Secure" by browsers. Modern APIs (geolocation, service workers, camera access) won't work. SEO is penalized. User data is exposed.

**Common causes:**
- Site never configured for HTTPS
- SSL certificate expired or misconfigured
- Mixed content (HTTPS page loading HTTP resources)

#### [Redirects HTTP to HTTPS](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/redirects-http)

**What it checks:** HTTP URLs automatically redirect to HTTPS.

**Why it's critical:** Users with bookmarks or links to HTTP versions bypass your HTTPS setup. Search engines may index both versions.

**Common causes:**
- Redirect not configured at server level
- Redirect configured in application but not at edge/CDN
- Missing HSTS headers

### High Impact - Security & Compatibility

These audits prevent security issues and ensure cross-browser compatibility.

#### [No Browser Errors](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/errors-in-console)

**What it checks:** No JavaScript errors in the console.

**Why it matters:** Console errors indicate broken functionality. Even if the site "works," something isn't running correctly. Errors also suggest poor code quality.

**Common causes:**
- Uncaught JavaScript exceptions
- Failed network requests for scripts
- Third-party scripts throwing errors
- Development code left in production

#### [Avoids Deprecated APIs](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/deprecations)

**What it checks:** No usage of APIs scheduled for removal.

**Why it matters:** Deprecated APIs will eventually break. The audit catches problems before they become production incidents.

**Common causes:**
- Old library versions using deprecated APIs
- Legacy code never updated
- Third-party scripts using outdated patterns

#### [Valid DOCTYPE](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/doctype)

**What it checks:** HTML5 `<!DOCTYPE html>` present at document start.

**Why it matters:** Without a proper doctype, browsers enter "quirks mode" with inconsistent rendering. Modern CSS and JS may behave unexpectedly.

**Common causes:**
- Missing doctype entirely
- Legacy doctype (HTML4, XHTML)
- Whitespace or BOM before doctype

#### [Valid Charset](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/charset)

**What it checks:** Character encoding declared via `<meta charset="utf-8">`.

**Why it matters:** Without explicit encoding, browsers guess—sometimes wrong. Non-ASCII characters (accents, symbols, emoji) can display as garbage.

**Common causes:**
- Missing charset meta tag
- Charset declared too late in document
- File encoding doesn't match declared charset

### Medium Impact - Performance & UX

These audits improve user experience and site performance.

#### [bfcache Eligible](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/bf-cache)

**What it checks:** Page can be stored in back/forward cache.

**Why it matters:** When eligible, back/forward navigation is instant. The browser restores the exact page state from memory. Users notice when this doesn't work.

**Common causes:**
- `unload` event listeners (use `pagehide` instead)
- `Cache-Control: no-store` header
- Open WebSocket or IndexedDB connections
- Certain browser extensions

#### [Proper Image Sizing](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/image-size-responsive)

**What it checks:** Rendered image size matches intrinsic size (within 10%).

**Why it matters:** Serving 2000px images for 200px displays wastes bandwidth. Serving 200px images for 2000px displays looks blurry.

**Common causes:**
- Missing responsive images (srcset)
- Fixed-size images on responsive layouts
- CMS uploading original images without optimization

#### [Correct Aspect Ratios](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/image-aspect-ratio)

**What it checks:** Displayed aspect ratio matches natural aspect ratio.

**Why it matters:** Stretched or squished images look broken. This usually indicates a CSS issue forcing wrong dimensions.

**Common causes:**
- CSS setting both width and height without `object-fit`
- Images in flex/grid containers being stretched
- Missing `aspect-ratio` CSS property

### Permission Audits

These audits check that permission requests happen in appropriate contexts.

#### [No Geolocation on Start](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/geolocation-on-start)

**What it checks:** `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` not called on page load.

**Why it matters:** Permission prompts without context feel invasive. Users deny them reflexively, then can't use location features when they actually want them.

**Fix pattern:** Only request geolocation after user action (clicking "Find nearby," "Use my location," etc.).

#### [No Notification on Start](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/notification-on-start)

**What it checks:** `Notification.requestPermission()` not called on page load.

**Why it matters:** Same principle as geolocation. Immediate notification prompts have near-zero acceptance rates and train users to deny all prompts.

**Fix pattern:** Ask for notifications after demonstrating value—after signup, after first engagement, after explaining benefits.

#### [Allows Paste in Passwords](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/paste-preventing-inputs)

**What it checks:** Password fields don't block paste operations.

**Why it matters:** Blocking paste breaks password managers. Password managers generate strong, unique passwords—blocking paste forces users toward weak, memorable passwords.

**Common causes:**
- `onpaste="return false"` event handlers
- JavaScript preventing paste events
- Misguided "security" measures

### Other Audits

#### [No DevTools Issues](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices/fix/inspector-issues)

**What it checks:** No issues flagged in Chrome DevTools Issues tab.

**Why it matters:** DevTools Issues aggregates various browser-detected problems—mixed content, cookie issues, CORS problems, etc.

**How to check:** Open DevTools → Issues tab → review all flagged items.

## Third-Party Script Issues

Many Best Practices failures come from third-party scripts you don't control:

- **Analytics scripts** throwing errors on blocked requests
- **Ad networks** using deprecated APIs
- **Chat widgets** requesting permissions on load
- **Social embeds** causing console errors

**What you can do:**
1. Report issues to the vendor
2. Load scripts conditionally (only when needed)
3. Wrap third-party code to catch and suppress errors (last resort)
4. Choose better vendors with cleaner implementations

Third-party issues are frustrating, but they're your site's responsibility. Users don't care whose code caused the problem.

## Test Every Page

Your homepage might pass while the checkout flow throws console errors. Blog posts might have image sizing issues. Legacy pages might use deprecated APIs.

[Unlighthouse](/cloud) scans your entire site and surfaces Best Practices scores for every page. You'll find the console error on that one contact form, the deprecated API in the admin panel, the permission prompt on the pricing page.

The CLI is free and runs locally. Cloud adds scheduled monitoring—catch regressions when a third-party script updates or new code introduces errors.
