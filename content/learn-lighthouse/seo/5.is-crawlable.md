Your page might have perfect content, optimized keywords, and fast loading times - but if search engines can't crawl it, none of that matters. Pages blocked from indexing are invisible to organic search.

## What's the Problem?

Search engines respect your instructions about what to crawl and index. When you (intentionally or accidentally) tell them "don't index this page," they comply. The page disappears from search results.

Three mechanisms can block indexing:

**1. Meta robots tag**
```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
```
This tells all search engines to not index the page.

**2. X-Robots-Tag HTTP header**
```
X-Robots-Tag: noindex
```
Same effect, but set at the server level rather than in HTML.

**3. robots.txt disallow**
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /private/
```
Prevents crawlers from accessing the URL at all.

The most common cause is accidental. A developer adds `noindex` during staging and forgets to remove it before launch. A robots.txt rule intended to block one directory matches more than expected. A CMS setting gets toggled without understanding the consequences.

The result is the same: search engines skip your page entirely, and you get zero organic traffic regardless of how good your content is.

## How to Identify This Issue

### Chrome DevTools

Check for meta robots tags:

1. Open Elements panel
2. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + F` and search for `robots`
3. Look for `<meta name="robots">` with `noindex` or `none` in the content

```js
// Console check for meta robots
const robotsMeta = document.querySelector('meta[name="robots"]')
if (robotsMeta) {
  const content = robotsMeta.content.toLowerCase()
  if (content.includes('noindex') || content.includes('none')) {
    console.warn('Page is blocked from indexing:', robotsMeta.outerHTML)
  }
}
```

Check HTTP headers in Network panel:
1. Reload with Network panel open
2. Click the main document request
3. Look for `X-Robots-Tag` in Response Headers

### Lighthouse

Run a Lighthouse SEO audit. Look for "Page is blocked from indexing" in the results.

The audit checks:
- `<meta name="robots">` for `noindex` or `none` directives
- `X-Robots-Tag` HTTP header for blocking directives
- `robots.txt` rules that disallow the page URL
- `unavailable_after` directives with past dates

Lighthouse tests against major bot user agents: Googlebot, Bingbot, DuckDuckBot, and others. If all bots are blocked, you fail. If at least one is allowed, you pass with a warning.

## The Fix

### 1. Remove Meta Robots Noindex

Find and remove or modify the blocking meta tag:

```html
<!-- Remove this entirely -->
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
<meta name="robots" content="none">

<!-- Or change to allow indexing -->
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
```

If you need `nofollow` (don't follow links) but want the page indexed:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="index, nofollow">
```

For bot-specific tags, check for both generic and specific:

```html
<!-- These also block indexing -->
<meta name="googlebot" content="noindex">
<meta name="bingbot" content="noindex">
```

### 2. Remove X-Robots-Tag Header

The fix depends on your server:

**Apache (.htaccess):**
```apache
Header set X-Robots-Tag "noindex"

<If "%{REQUEST_URI} =~ m#^/admin/#">
  Header set X-Robots-Tag "noindex"
</If>
```

**Nginx:**
```nginx
add_header X-Robots-Tag "noindex";

location /admin/ {
  add_header X-Robots-Tag "noindex";
}
```

**Node.js/Express:**
```js
// Remove this middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('X-Robots-Tag', 'noindex')
  next()
})

// Or apply selectively
app.use('/admin', (req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('X-Robots-Tag', 'noindex')
  next()
})
```

### 3. Fix robots.txt Rules

Check your robots.txt for overly broad rules:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /

User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /api/
Disallow: /tmp/
```

Common mistakes:

```txt
Disallow: /*?*

Disallow: /*.pdf$

Disallow: /staging  # Also matches /staging-guide, /staging-area
```

Test your robots.txt rules:

```bash
curl https://yourdomain.com/robots.txt
```

Use Google Search Console's robots.txt Tester to verify specific URLs are allowed.

### 4. Check for Conditional Noindex

Some setups add noindex based on conditions:

```js
// Development environment check gone wrong
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  // This is correct
}

// But this is dangerous if NODE_ENV isn't set correctly in production
if (!process.env.PRODUCTION) {
  meta.push({ name: 'robots', content: 'noindex' })
}
```

Verify your production environment doesn't have staging configurations.

## Framework-Specific Solutions

::callout{icon="i-logos-nextjs-icon"}
**Next.js** - Check your metadata configuration:

```tsx
// Remove robots noindex from your metadata
export const metadata = {
  robots: {
    index: true, // Explicitly allow indexing
    follow: true
  }
}

// For pages that should not be indexed (intentional)
export const metadata = {
  robots: {
    index: false,
    follow: false
  }
}
```

Also check `next.config.js` for any custom headers adding X-Robots-Tag.

::callout{icon="i-logos-nuxt-icon"}
**Nuxt** - Check `nuxt.config.ts` and page-level settings:

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts - remove if blocking unintentionally
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  app: {
    head: {
      meta: [
        // Remove this if present
        // { name: 'robots', content: 'noindex' }
      ]
    }
  }
})
```

```vue
<script setup>
// Page-level - only use for pages that shouldn't be indexed
useSeoMeta({
  robots: 'index, follow'
})
</script>
```
::

## Verify the Fix

After removing indexing blocks:

**1. Re-run Lighthouse**

The "Page is blocked from indexing" audit should pass.

**2. Check multiple sources**

Verify all three mechanisms are clear:

```bash
curl -s https://example.com/page | grep -i "robots"

curl -I https://example.com/page | grep -i "x-robots"

curl -s https://example.com/robots.txt
```

**3. Google Search Console**

Use URL Inspection to submit the page for indexing. The tool shows exactly what Google sees and whether indexing is allowed.

**4. Wait and verify indexing**

Search `site:example.com/page-url` after a few days. If the page appears, it's being indexed correctly.

## Common Mistakes

- **Removing noindex from pages that should be blocked** — Admin pages, user dashboards, checkout flows, and internal tools should remain noindexed. Don't remove blocks without understanding why they exist.

- **Leaving robots.txt Disallow in place** — Removing meta noindex but keeping robots.txt Disallow means crawlers still can't access the page. Both need to be addressed.

- **Environment-specific configurations leaking** — Staging settings deployed to production is extremely common. Always verify production environment after deployments.

- **CMS settings overriding code** — WordPress, Shopify, and other CMS platforms have their own SEO settings that might add noindex. Check the CMS configuration, not just the code.

- **Expired unavailable_after dates** — The directive `unavailable_after: 01-Jan-2024` blocks indexing after that date. If you used this for temporary content, remove it when you want the content back.

- **CDN or proxy adding headers** — Cloudflare, Fastly, or your CDN might add X-Robots-Tag. Check your edge configuration, not just origin server.

## Related Issues

Crawlability issues often appear alongside:
- [Robots.txt](/learn-lighthouse/seo/robots-txt) — Check robots.txt for Disallow rules blocking the page
- [HTTP Status Code](/learn-lighthouse/seo/http-status-code) — Both prevent indexing, diagnose which applies
- [Canonical](/learn-lighthouse/seo/canonical) — Noindexed pages shouldn't be canonical targets

## Test Your Entire Site

One misconfigured template can block thousands of pages. A robots.txt typo can exclude your entire site. CMS updates can reset SEO settings to defaults. Unlighthouse scans every URL on your site and identifies every page blocked from indexing, so you can catch issues that would otherwise remain invisible until you notice organic traffic dropping.
