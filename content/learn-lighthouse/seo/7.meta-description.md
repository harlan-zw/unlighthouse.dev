Pages with custom meta descriptions get 5.8% higher click-through rates than those using auto-generated snippets. Without one, Google decides what to show - and it's rarely optimal.

**Reality check:** [Google rewrites 62.78% of meta descriptions](https://ahrefs.com/blog/site-audit-study/) anyway, choosing to display content it thinks better matches the query. And [25% of top-ranking pages have no meta description at all](https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-statistics/). So missing descriptions won't prevent ranking—but you lose control of what appears in search results.

## What's the Problem?

When your page lacks a meta description, search engines generate one automatically by extracting text from your page content. This sounds helpful until you realize the algorithm doesn't understand context, value propositions, or what makes users click.

Google might pull a random sentence from your footer. Bing might grab your cookie policy notice. The result is a search snippet that fails to communicate why someone should visit your page over the other nine results.

**The technical issue is simple:** Lighthouse checks for a `<meta name="description">` tag in your document head. If it's missing or empty, you fail the audit. But the real problem is strategic - you're giving up control of the single piece of text that represents your page in search results.

Consider what happens when someone searches for "best project management software":

- **With meta description:** "Compare 15 project management tools with real user reviews. Find the right fit for teams of 1-1000. Updated January 2025."
- **Without meta description:** "...cookies to improve your experience. By continuing to use this site..."

One gets clicked. One gets scrolled past.

## How to Identify This Issue

### Chrome DevTools

Open the Elements panel and search for `meta name="description"`:

1. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + F` in Elements panel
2. Search for `meta name="description"`
3. Check if it exists and has content

Quick console check:

```js
const meta = document.querySelector('meta[name="description"]')
console.log(meta ? meta.content : 'No meta description found')
```

If the content is empty or missing entirely, you have the issue.

### Lighthouse

Run a Lighthouse SEO audit. Look for "Document does not have a meta description" in the results. The audit is binary - you either have a valid meta description or you don't.

Lighthouse specifically checks that:

- A `<meta name="description">` element exists in the document
- The `content` attribute contains non-empty text (not just whitespace)

## The Fix

### 1. Add the Meta Description Tag

Place this in your document's `<head>`:

```html
<head>
  <meta name="description" content="Your compelling description here. Aim for 150-160 characters that summarize the page and encourage clicks.">
</head>
```

Write descriptions that:

- Summarize what the page offers in 150-160 characters
- Include relevant keywords naturally (not stuffed)
- Contain a value proposition or call to action
- Are unique to each page

**Examples by page type:**

```html
<!-- Homepage -->
<meta name="description" content="Open-source project management for developers. GitHub integration, Kanban boards, and sprint planning. Free for teams up to 10.">

<!-- Product page -->
<meta name="description" content="Wireless noise-canceling headphones with 40-hour battery life. Premium audio, comfortable fit, and seamless device switching. Ships free.">

<!-- Blog post -->
<meta name="description" content="Step-by-step guide to migrating from REST to GraphQL without breaking your existing clients. Includes code examples and rollback strategies.">

<!-- Documentation -->
<meta name="description" content="Complete API reference for the Authentication module. Covers OAuth 2.0 flows, JWT tokens, refresh handling, and error codes.">
```

### 2. Template-Based Descriptions

For sites with many similar pages, create templates:

```html
<!-- Product template -->
<meta name="description" content="Buy {product_name} - {key_feature}. {price}. Free shipping on orders over $50.">

<!-- Category template -->
<meta name="description" content="Shop {category_name} - {product_count} items. Filter by {popular_filters}. Fast delivery.">

<!-- Blog template -->
<meta name="description" content="{first_150_chars_of_content}">
```

Templated descriptions are better than none, but custom descriptions outperform templates when you have the resources.

### 3. Dynamic Meta Descriptions

For SPAs and dynamic content, set descriptions programmatically:

```js
// Vanilla JS
// React Helmet
import { Helmet } from 'react-helmet'

function setMetaDescription(content) {
  let meta = document.querySelector('meta[name="description"]')
  if (!meta) {
    meta = document.createElement('meta')
    meta.name = 'description'
    document.head.appendChild(meta)
  }
  meta.content = content
}

function ProductPage({ product }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Helmet>
        <meta name="description" content={`${product.name} - ${product.shortDescription}`} />
      </Helmet>
      {/* page content */}
    </>
  )
}
```

## Framework-Specific Solutions

::callout{icon="i-logos-nextjs-icon"}
**Next.js** - Use the Metadata API in App Router:

```tsx
export const metadata = {
  description: 'Your page description here'
}

// Or generate dynamically
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const product = await getProduct(params.id)
  return { description: product.summary }
}
```

::

::callout{icon="i-logos-nuxt-icon"}
**Nuxt** - Use `useSeoMeta` composable:

```html
<script setup>
useSeoMeta({
  description: 'Your page description here'
})

// Or with dynamic data
const { data: product } = await useFetch('/api/product')
useSeoMeta({
  description: product.value.summary
})
</script>
```

::

## Verify the Fix

After adding meta descriptions:

**1. View page source**

Press `Ctrl/Cmd + U` and search for `meta name="description"`. Confirm it appears in the `<head>` with your content.

**2. Re-run Lighthouse**

The "Document does not have a meta description" audit should pass. If it still fails, check that:

- The tag is in `<head>`, not `<body>`
- The `content` attribute isn't empty
- There are no syntax errors in the HTML

**3. Test in Google Search Console**

Use the URL Inspection tool to see how Google renders your page. Check that the meta description is detected.

**4. Preview your snippet**

Search for `site:yourdomain.com/page-url` to see how the description appears in actual search results. Note that Google may choose to show different text if it believes it better matches the query.

## Common Mistakes

- **Duplicate descriptions across pages** — Every page needs a unique description. Using the same text everywhere dilutes your SEO and confuses users about page differences.

- **Descriptions over 160 characters** — Google truncates long descriptions with "...". Keep the most important information in the first 120 characters.

- **Keyword stuffing** — "Best project management software, top project management, free project management tool" reads like spam and may hurt rankings.

- **Descriptions that don't match content** — If your description promises something the page doesn't deliver, users bounce immediately. Google notices.

- **Forgetting dynamic pages** — SPAs often fail to update meta tags on navigation. Test each route, not just the initial load.

- **Empty content attribute** — `<meta name="description" content="">` technically exists but fails the audit. The content must have actual text.

## Related Issues

Meta description issues often appear alongside:

- [Document Title](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/document-title) — Both are critical document metadata
- [Canonical](/learn-lighthouse/seo/canonical) — Pages with duplicate descriptions may need canonicalization
- [Hreflang](/learn-lighthouse/seo/hreflang) — Each language version needs unique descriptions

## Test Your Entire Site

One template with a missing meta description could affect thousands of pages. A CMS update might have broken your SEO plugin. Unlighthouse scans every URL on your site and flags pages missing meta descriptions, so you can catch issues across your entire domain, not just the pages you remember to check.
