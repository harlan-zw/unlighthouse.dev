# Playwright Lighthouse in GitHub Actions

Run Lighthouse audits automatically on every pull request. This guide covers GitHub Actions setup with Playwright-based Lighthouse integration.

::note
**Alternative**: For dedicated CI tooling, consider [Lighthouse CI](/learn-lighthouse/lighthouse-ci/github-actions) which is purpose-built for CI pipelines with historical tracking and GitHub status checks.
::

## Basic Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml`:

```yaml
name: Lighthouse Audit
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npx playwright install chromium --with-deps

      - name: Run Lighthouse audit
        run: node scripts/lighthouse-audit.js

      - name: Upload report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: lighthouse-report
          path: lighthouse-report.html
          retention-days: 14
```

Create `scripts/lighthouse-audit.js`:

```js
import { writeFileSync } from 'node:fs'
import lighthouse from 'lighthouse'
import { chromium } from 'playwright'

const PORT = 9222
const URL = process.env.AUDIT_URL || 'https://example.com'
const THRESHOLDS = {
  'performance': 80,
  'accessibility': 90,
  'best-practices': 80,
  'seo': 80,
}

async function audit() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({
    args: [`--remote-debugging-port=${PORT}`],
  })

  const page = await browser.newPage()
  await page.goto(URL, { waitUntil: 'networkidle' })

  const result = await lighthouse(URL, {
    port: PORT,
    output: 'html',
    logLevel: 'error',
  })

  writeFileSync('lighthouse-report.html', result.report)

  const { categories } = result.lhr
  let failed = false

  for (const [key, threshold] of Object.entries(THRESHOLDS)) {
    const score = Math.round(categories[key].score * 100)
    const status = score >= threshold ? '✅' : '❌'
    console.log(`${status} ${key}: ${score} (threshold: ${threshold})`)
    if (score < threshold)
      failed = true
  }

  await browser.close()

  if (failed) {
    console.error('\nLighthouse audit failed to meet thresholds')
    process.exit(1)
  }
}

audit()
```

## Testing Preview Deployments

For Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages preview URLs:

```yaml
name: Lighthouse on Preview
on: deployment_status

jobs:
  lighthouse:
    if: github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install chromium --with-deps

      - name: Run Lighthouse
        run: node scripts/lighthouse-audit.js
        env:
          AUDIT_URL: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.target_url }}

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: lighthouse-report
          path: lighthouse-report.html
```

## Testing Multiple URLs

Audit several pages in one workflow:

```js
// scripts/lighthouse-audit.js
const URLS = [
  'https://example.com/',
  'https://example.com/pricing',
  'https://example.com/docs',
]

async function auditAll() {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({
    args: [`--remote-debugging-port=${PORT}`],
  })

  const results = []

  for (const url of URLS) {
    const page = await browser.newPage()
    await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'networkidle' })

    const result = await lighthouse(url, {
      port: PORT,
      logLevel: 'error',
    })

    results.push({
      url,
      performance: Math.round(result.lhr.categories.performance.score * 100),
      accessibility: Math.round(result.lhr.categories.accessibility.score * 100),
    })

    await page.close()
  }

  await browser.close()

  console.table(results)

  // Fail if any page is below threshold
  const failed = results.some(r => r.performance < 80)
  if (failed)
    process.exit(1)
}
```

## With Authentication

For protected pages, use saved auth state:

```yaml
- name: Run Lighthouse on authenticated pages
  run: node scripts/lighthouse-auth-audit.js
  env:
    TEST_USER_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.TEST_USER_EMAIL }}
    TEST_USER_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TEST_USER_PASSWORD }}
```

See [Authentication Guide](/learn-lighthouse/playwright/authentication) for the full script.

## Reducing Variance

Lighthouse scores vary between runs. Run multiple times and use median:

```js
async function auditWithMedian(url, runs = 3) {
  const scores = []

  for (let i = 0; i < runs; i++) {
    const result = await lighthouse(url, { port: PORT, logLevel: 'error' })
    scores.push(result.lhr.categories.performance.score * 100)
  }

  scores.sort((a, b) => a - b)
  return scores[Math.floor(scores.length / 2)] // Median
}
```

::note
Running 3 audits and taking the median [reduces variance by ~37%](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/web-performance-test-variability). For critical thresholds, use 5 runs.
::

## PR Comments with Results

Post Lighthouse scores as a PR comment:

```yaml
- name: Comment PR
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      const fs = require('fs')
      const results = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('lighthouse-results.json'))

      const body = `## Lighthouse Results

      | Metric | Score |
      |--------|-------|
      | Performance | ${results.performance} |
      | Accessibility | ${results.accessibility} |
      | Best Practices | ${results.bestPractices} |
      | SEO | ${results.seo} |`

      github.rest.issues.createComment({
        issue_number: context.issue.number,
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        body
      })
```

## Caching Playwright Browsers

Speed up workflows by caching Chromium:

```yaml
- name: Cache Playwright browsers
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/ms-playwright
    key: playwright-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}

- name: Install Playwright (use cache)
  run: npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

## Full Production Workflow

```yaml
name: Lighthouse CI
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22
          cache: npm

      - name: Cache Playwright
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.cache/ms-playwright
          key: playwright-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install chromium --with-deps

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Start server
        run: npm run preview &

      - name: Wait for server
        run: npx wait-on http://localhost:4173

      - name: Run Lighthouse
        run: node scripts/lighthouse-audit.js
        env:
          AUDIT_URL: http://localhost:4173

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: lighthouse-report
          path: lighthouse-report.html
          retention-days: 14
```

## When to Use Lighthouse CI Instead

For advanced CI features, [Lighthouse CI](/learn-lighthouse/lighthouse-ci) provides:

- Historical tracking across builds
- GitHub status checks (not just comments)
- Baseline comparisons
- Built-in assertion presets

The Playwright approach works well for simpler setups or when you need custom control over the browser context (like authentication).
