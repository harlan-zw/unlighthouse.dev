# Accessibility Issues & Fixes

Not sure why your accessibility score is failing? This page covers every Lighthouse accessibility audit grouped by category.

Unlike performance metrics, accessibility audits are binary. Each element either passes or fails the check. Fix the failing elements to pass the audit.

## Diagnose Your Issue

Before jumping into fixes, identify exactly what is failing.

**Chrome DevTools (Quick Check):**
1. Open DevTools → **Lighthouse** tab
2. Run an accessibility audit
3. Expand failing audits to see affected elements
4. Click elements to locate them in the DOM

**axe DevTools (Detailed):**
Install the [axe DevTools extension](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/) for more detailed explanations and fix suggestions.

**Accessibility Tree:**
1. Open DevTools → **Elements** tab
2. Open the **Accessibility** pane
3. Toggle "Enable full-page accessibility tree"
4. See how assistive technology interprets your page

**What to look for:**
- Elements with missing accessible names
- Invalid ARIA attributes or roles
- Color contrast failures
- Missing or incorrect document metadata
- Improper heading structure

## All Accessibility Issues by Category

### Names and Labels

Interactive elements need accessible names so screen readers can announce them. These are the most common failures.

#### [Image Alt Text](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/image-alt)
`image-alt` - Images must have alternative text. Informative images need descriptive alt. Decorative images need `alt=""`. Images inside links need alt text that describes the link destination.

#### [Link Name](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/link-name)
`link-name` - Links must have discernible text. Icon-only links need `aria-label`. Image links need alt text. Never use "click here" or "read more" alone.

#### [Button Name](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/button-name)
`button-name` - Buttons must have accessible names. Icon buttons need `aria-label`. Submit buttons need visible text or `value` attribute.

#### [Form Labels](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/label)
`label` - Form inputs need associated labels. Use `<label for="id">` or wrap input in label. Placeholder text is not a substitute for labels.

#### Select Name
`select-name` - Select elements need accessible names via label, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`.

#### Input Image Alt
`input-image-alt` - `<input type="image">` elements need alt attributes describing the action.

#### [Frame Title](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/frame-title)
`frame-title` - Frames and iframes need title attributes describing their content.

#### Object Alt
`object-alt` - `<object>` elements need alternative text via inner content or `aria-label`.

---

### ARIA

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes extend HTML semantics. Incorrect ARIA causes more accessibility problems than no ARIA.

#### Valid Roles
`aria-roles` - The `role` attribute must use valid ARIA role values. Typos or made-up roles are ignored by assistive technology.

#### Allowed Attributes
`aria-allowed-attr` - ARIA attributes must be valid for the element's role. Using `aria-checked` on an element without a checkbox role is invalid.

#### [Required Attributes](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/aria-required-attr)
`aria-required-attr` - Some ARIA roles require specific attributes. A slider needs `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, and `aria-valuemax`.

#### Valid Attribute Values
`aria-valid-attr-value` - ARIA attribute values must match expected types. `aria-hidden` accepts `true` or `false`, not `yes` or `no`.

#### [Valid Attributes](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/aria-valid-attr)
`aria-valid-attr` - Only use attributes from the ARIA specification. `aria-label` is valid. `aria-description` with a typo is not.

#### Required Children
`aria-required-children` - Container roles require specific child roles. A `role="list"` must contain `role="listitem"` children.

#### Required Parent
`aria-required-parent` - Some roles must be nested within specific parent roles. `role="listitem"` must be inside `role="list"`.

#### Hidden Body
`aria-hidden-body` - Never put `aria-hidden="true"` on the body element. This hides the entire page from screen readers.

#### [Hidden Focus](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/aria-hidden-focus)
`aria-hidden-focus` - Elements with `aria-hidden="true"` must not contain focusable elements. This creates confusion when focus enters invisible areas.

#### Input Field Name
`aria-input-field-name` - ARIA input fields (textbox, combobox, etc.) need accessible names.

#### Toggle Field Name
`aria-toggle-field-name` - ARIA toggle controls (checkbox, switch, etc.) need accessible names.

#### Duplicate IDs
`duplicate-id-aria` - IDs referenced by ARIA attributes must be unique. Duplicate IDs cause `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` to reference wrong elements.

#### Prohibited Attributes
`aria-prohibited-attr` - Some ARIA attributes are not allowed on certain roles. These create conflicts in assistive technology.

#### Conditional Attributes
`aria-conditional-attr` - ARIA attributes that depend on element state must be applied correctly.

#### Deprecated Roles
`aria-deprecated-role` - Avoid deprecated ARIA roles that may not be supported in modern assistive technology.

#### Allowed Roles
`aria-allowed-role` - The `role` attribute value must be appropriate for the element type.

#### ARIA Text
`aria-text` - Elements with `role="text"` should not contain focusable descendants.

#### Dialog Name
`aria-dialog-name` - Dialog and alertdialog roles need accessible names via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.

#### Meter Name
`aria-meter-name` - Elements with `role="meter"` need accessible names.

#### Progressbar Name
`aria-progressbar-name` - Elements with `role="progressbar"` need accessible names.

#### Tooltip Name
`aria-tooltip-name` - Elements with `role="tooltip"` need accessible names.

#### Treeitem Name
`aria-treeitem-name` - Elements with `role="treeitem"` need accessible names.

#### Command Name
`aria-command-name` - Button, link, and menuitem roles need accessible names.

---

### Color and Contrast

Color cannot be the only way to convey information. Text must be readable.

#### [Color Contrast](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/color-contrast)
`color-contrast` - Text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (18px+ or 14px+ bold) against its background.

#### Link in Text Block
`link-in-text-block` - Links within blocks of text must be distinguishable by more than color alone. Use underlines or other visual indicators.

---

### Document Structure

Proper document structure helps users understand and navigate content.

#### [Document Title](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/document-title)
`document-title` - Every page needs a `<title>` element. Screen readers announce this when loading the page. It also appears in browser tabs and search results.

#### [HTML Has Lang](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/html-has-lang)
`html-has-lang` - The `<html>` element needs a `lang` attribute. Screen readers use this to select the correct pronunciation rules.

#### HTML Lang Valid
`html-lang-valid` - The `lang` attribute must use a valid BCP 47 language code. Use `en` for English, `es` for Spanish, etc.

#### XML Lang Mismatch
`html-xml-lang-mismatch` - When both `lang` and `xml:lang` are present, they must match.

#### Valid Lang
`valid-lang` - Elements with a `lang` attribute must use valid language codes.

#### [Heading Order](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/heading-order)
`heading-order` - Heading levels should increase by one. Do not skip from h1 to h3. Screen reader users navigate by heading level.

#### Empty Heading
`empty-heading` - Heading elements must have text content. Empty headings confuse screen reader users navigating by headings.

#### Landmark One Main
`landmark-one-main` - Pages should have one main landmark (`<main>` or `role="main"`) to identify the primary content area.

---

### Navigation

Navigation must work for keyboard users and screen reader users.

#### [Bypass Blocks](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/bypass)
`bypass` - Pages should provide a way to skip repetitive navigation. Use skip links, headings, or landmark regions.

#### [Tabindex](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/tabindex)
`tabindex` - Avoid `tabindex` values greater than 0. They create unpredictable tab order. Use `tabindex="0"` to add elements to natural tab order and `tabindex="-1"` for programmatic focus.

#### Access Keys
`accesskeys` - Access key values must be unique. Duplicate keys create conflicts on which element receives focus.

#### Skip Link
`skip-link` - Skip links must have focusable targets. The target element should be focusable or the skip link will not work.

---

### Tables and Lists

Data tables and lists need proper structure for assistive technology.

#### Table Headers
`td-has-header` - Data cells in large tables need associated headers. Use `<th>` elements or `scope` attributes so screen readers can announce context.

#### TH Has Data Cells
`th-has-data-cells` - Table headers must be associated with data cells. Orphan headers indicate table structure problems.

#### TD Headers Attr
`td-headers-attr` - The `headers` attribute on `<td>` elements must reference valid `<th>` IDs.

#### Table Duplicate Name
`table-duplicate-name` - Tables should not have duplicate accessible names on the same page.

#### Table Fake Caption
`table-fake-caption` - Use `<caption>` for table titles instead of cells with `colspan`.

#### Definition List
`definition-list` - Definition lists must only contain properly structured `<dt>` and `<dd>` groups.

#### DL Item
`dlitem` - `<dt>` and `<dd>` elements must be contained in a `<dl>`.

#### List
`list` - Lists must only contain `<li>`, `<script>`, or `<template>` elements.

#### List Item
`listitem` - `<li>` elements must be contained within `<ul>` or `<ol>`.

---

### Interactive Elements

Interactive elements need proper sizing and behavior.

#### [Target Size](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/target-size)
`target-size` - Touch targets should be at least 24x24 CSS pixels. Small targets are difficult for users with motor impairments.

#### [Meta Viewport](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/meta-viewport)
`meta-viewport` - Do not disable user scaling with `user-scalable="no"` or `maximum-scale=1`. Users with low vision need to zoom.

#### Meta Refresh
`meta-refresh` - Do not use `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` to redirect or refresh. Automatic changes disorient users.

---

### Media

Audio and video content needs alternatives.

#### Video Caption
`video-caption` - Videos with audio need captions for deaf users and users in sound-sensitive environments.

## Decision Tree

Not sure which category your issue falls into?

1. **Run Lighthouse accessibility audit**
2. **Check the audit ID** (shown in parentheses after the title)
3. **Find the audit above** by ID

If multiple audits fail, prioritize by impact:
1. **Critical**: `aria-hidden-body`, empty content warnings
2. **High**: Color contrast, missing names/labels, invalid ARIA
3. **Medium**: Heading order, document structure
4. **Low**: Best practices like duplicate access keys

## Framework Considerations

Different frameworks have different common accessibility problems:

| Framework | Common Issues | Quick Fix |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **React** | Missing labels on custom components, incorrect ARIA | Use semantic HTML, audit component libraries |
| **Vue** | Dynamic content not announced, focus management | Use `aria-live` regions, manage focus on route change |
| **Angular** | Form label associations broken by templates | Use explicit `for` attributes, test with screen reader |
| **Next.js** | Client-side routing not announced | Use built-in announcer or manage focus manually |
| **Nuxt** | Similar to Next.js | Use `@nuxtjs/a11y` module for automated checks |
| **Svelte** | Minimal issues if using semantic HTML | Audit any component libraries |

## Test Every Page

Here is the problem with fixing accessibility: your marketing pages might pass while app screens fail. Your public pages might be accessible while authenticated pages are not.

Different content types have different issues. Blog posts might have missing alt text. Forms might have missing labels. Modals might trap focus.

[Unlighthouse](/cloud) scans every page on your site and surfaces accessibility scores across all of them. You will see which templates have issues, which pages are outliers, and whether your fixes actually work at scale.

The CLI is free and runs locally. Cloud adds scheduled monitoring to catch regressions when content changes.
