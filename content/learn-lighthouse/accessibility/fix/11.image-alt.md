# Fix Missing Image Alt Text

Screen readers announce images without alt text as "image" or read the filename, leaving millions of visually impaired users guessing what content they're missing.

## What's Happening

Lighthouse flags `<img>` elements that lack an `alt` attribute entirely. Every image needs one of three things: descriptive alt text for informative images, an empty `alt=""` for decorative images, or `role="presentation"` to explicitly mark the image as non-essential. Without these, assistive technology cannot communicate the image's purpose.

## Diagnose

1. Open DevTools and run Lighthouse accessibility audit
2. Expand "Image elements do not have `[alt]` attributes"
3. Click flagged images to locate them in the DOM
4. Check the Elements panel for the presence and value of the `alt` attribute
5. Right-click the image and select "Open image in new tab" to understand its content

## Fix

### 1. Add Descriptive Alt Text (Informative Images)

Write concise text that conveys the image's meaning in context.

```html
<!-- Before: no alt attribute -->
<img src="/team/sarah.jpg">

<!-- After: descriptive alt -->
<img src="/team/sarah.jpg" alt="Sarah Chen, Lead Developer">
```

```html
<!-- Before: missing alt on functional image -->
<a href="/search">
  <img src="/icons/search.svg">
</a>

<!-- After: alt describes the action -->
<a href="/search">
  <img src="/icons/search.svg" alt="Search">
</a>
```

### 2. Use Empty Alt for Decorative Images

Images that add visual interest but no information should have empty alt text.

```html
<!-- Decorative divider -->
<img src="/divider-ornament.svg" alt="">

<!-- Background pattern in content -->
<img src="/hero-pattern.png" alt="">
```

### 3. Use role="presentation" for Layout Images

For images used purely for layout or spacing, remove them from the accessibility tree.

```html
<!-- Spacer image (consider replacing with CSS) -->
<img src="/spacer.gif" role="presentation">

<!-- Or equivalently -->
<img src="/spacer.gif" alt="" role="none">
```

## Framework Examples

::callout{icon="i-logos-nuxt-icon"}
Nuxt Image (`<NuxtImg>`) still requires alt attributes just like native images. Create a composable to enforce alt text in your components:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const props = defineProps<{
  src: string
  alt: string // Required prop enforces alt at build time
}>()
</script>

<template>
  <NuxtImg
    :src="props.src"
    :alt="props.alt"
  />
</template>
```

Use ESLint with `eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility` to catch missing alt attributes during development.

## Verify the Fix

1. Re-run Lighthouse and confirm the audit passes
2. Use a screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA) to navigate your images
3. Check that decorative images are skipped by the screen reader
4. Verify functional images (links, buttons) announce their purpose

## Common Mistakes

- **Using filenames as alt text** — "IMG_2847.jpg" or "hero-banner-final-v2.png" tells users nothing

- **Starting with "Image of" or "Picture of"** — Screen readers already announce it's an image; this is redundant

- **Writing alt text that's too long** — Keep it under 125 characters; use `longdesc` or surrounding text for complex images

- **Using the same alt text for different images** — Each image's alt should reflect its specific content and context

- **Leaving alt empty on functional images** — Images inside links or buttons must describe the action, not be empty

## Related Issues

Image alt issues often appear alongside:
- [Link Name](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/link-name) — Images inside links need alt text describing the destination
- [Button Name](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/button-name) — Icon buttons with images need accessible names
- [Frame Title](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility/fix/frame-title) — Both involve describing embedded content

## Test Your Entire Site

Missing alt text often accumulates in blog posts, product pages, and user-generated content areas that grow over time. Unlighthouse crawls your entire site to surface every image lacking proper alt text, generating a comprehensive report you can work through systematically.
