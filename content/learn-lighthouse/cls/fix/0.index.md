# CLS Issues & Fixes

Not sure what's causing your layout shifts? This page covers every common cause with links to detailed fix guides.

Lighthouse's "Avoid large layout shifts" audit shows up to 15 layout shifts with their root causes: unsized media, web font loading, or injected iframes. Find your specific issue below.

## Diagnose Your Issue

Before jumping into fixes, identify exactly what's shifting.

**Chrome DevTools (Quick Check):**

1. Open DevTools → **Performance** tab
2. Check "Web Vitals" in the sidebar
3. Click record → reload page → stop recording
4. Look for pink **"Layout Shift"** entries in the timeline
5. Click a shift to see the affected element and shift score

**Performance Observer (Real-time):**

Paste this in the Console to catch shifts as they happen:

```js
new PerformanceObserver((l) => {
  l.getEntries().forEach((e) => {
    if (!e.hadRecentInput) {
      console.log('CLS:', e.value.toFixed(4), e.sources)
    }
  })
}).observe({ type: 'layout-shift', buffered: true })
```

Reload and interact with the page—shifts will log with their source elements.

**Lighthouse Audit:**

Run Lighthouse and check "Avoid large layout shifts" under Diagnostics. It shows:
- The element that shifted most for each layout shift event
- The shift score contribution
- Root cause: "Media element lacking explicit size", "Web font loaded", or "Injected iframe"

**What to look for:**
- Is an image or video causing the shift? → [Unsized Images](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/unsized-images)
- Multiple shift sources or unclear cause? → [Large Layout Shifts](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/layout-shifts)
- Is text reflowing when fonts load? → [Web Fonts](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/web-fonts-causing-foit)
- Is an ad, embed, or iframe appearing? → [Ads & Embeds](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/ads-embeds-iframes)

## All CLS Causes

### High Impact

These cause the biggest CLS problems. Fix these first.

#### [Unsized Images](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/unsized-images)

[66% of mobile pages still contain at least one unsized image](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/performance)—the most common CLS culprit.

When an image loads without `width` and `height` attributes, the browser reserves 0x0 space. Once the image downloads, it expands and pushes everything below it down.

Lighthouse flags this as: **"Media element lacking an explicit size"**

**Quick fix:** Add `width` and `height` to every `<img>` element. Use `aspect-ratio` in CSS if you need responsive sizing.

#### [Large Layout Shifts](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/layout-shifts)

Lighthouse's "Avoid large layout shifts" audit reports the top shifts on your page with root causes: unsized media, web fonts, or injected iframes.

Use this guide when you have multiple shifts or need help diagnosing the root cause. It covers all three issues Lighthouse detects and shows how to fix each.

**Quick fix:** Check root causes in Lighthouse results, then apply the specific fix for each (dimensions, font loading, iframe containers).

### Medium Impact

#### [Web Fonts (FOIT/FOUT)](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/web-fonts-causing-foit)

Text resizes when custom fonts load, shifting surrounding content. [Only 11% of pages preload web fonts](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/performance) to prevent this.

Lighthouse flags this as: **"Web font loaded"**

FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text) and FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text) both cause layout shifts when the font swap happens.

**Quick fix:** Use `font-display: swap` with `<link rel="preload">` for fonts, or use a fallback font with similar metrics.

#### [Ads, Embeds, iframes](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/ads-embeds-iframes)

Third-party content with variable or unknown dimensions that loads and shifts content.

Lighthouse flags this as: **"Injected iframe"**

Ads are particularly problematic because:
- Dimensions vary per ad campaign
- Load timing is unpredictable
- Third-party scripts control the rendering

**Quick fix:** Reserve fixed space for ad slots. Use `min-height` on containers. Consider skeleton placeholders.

### Lower Impact (but common)

#### [Animations & Transitions](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/animations-transitions)

[39% of mobile pages use non-composited animations](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/performance) that animate layout properties instead of `transform`/`opacity`.

Animating `width`, `height`, `margin`, or `top`/`left` triggers layout recalculation and can cause CLS.

**Quick fix:** Use `transform` for movement (e.g., `translateX` instead of `left`). Use `opacity` for visibility changes.

## Decision Tree

Still not sure which cause applies? Work through this:

1. **Run the Performance Observer snippet above.** What element appears in the console when a shift happens?

2. **Is it an image or video?**
   - Does it have width/height attributes? → [Unsized Images](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/unsized-images)

3. **Is it text content?**
   - Does the shift happen when fonts load? → [Web Fonts](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/web-fonts-causing-foit)
   - Does it appear after page load? → [Large Layout Shifts](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/layout-shifts)

4. **Is it an iframe, embed, or ad?**
   - → [Ads & Embeds](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/ads-embeds-iframes)

5. **Is something animating or transitioning?**
   - Check if animation uses layout properties → [Animations](/learn-lighthouse/cls/fix/animations-transitions)

6. **Multiple causes?** Start with the highest-impact issue first. Often fixing unsized images eliminates most of your CLS score.

## Framework-Specific Issues

Different frameworks have different common CLS problems:

| Framework | Most Common CLS Issues | Quick Fix |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Next.js** | next/image without dimensions, font loading | Use `width`/`height` props, use `next/font` |
| **Nuxt** | NuxtImg sizing, layout hydration | Set dimensions, check SSR/CSR mismatches |
| **React** | Suspense boundaries, conditional rendering | Size Suspense fallbacks, reserve space for conditionals |
| **Vue** | v-if/v-show transitions, async components | Use transitions with fixed dimensions |
| **Svelte** | enhanced:img sizing, in/out transitions | Add dimensions, use `animate:` with transforms |
| **Angular** | NgOptimizedImage config, dynamic components | Configure image sizing, reserve component space |

→ See [framework-specific guides](/frameworks) for detailed walkthroughs.

## Verify Your Fixes

After implementing fixes, confirm they worked:

1. **Re-run Lighthouse** — CLS score should improve, "Avoid large layout shifts" should show fewer items
2. **Check field data** — Give it a few days, then check PageSpeed Insights or Search Console for improved CrUX scores
3. **Test on slow connections** — Use DevTools Network throttling to simulate 3G; shifts are more visible when content loads slowly

**Target:** CLS ≤ 0.1 for a "Good" score. Anything over 0.25 is considered "Poor."

## Test Every Page

Checking pages one-by-one is tedious. Your homepage might pass while every blog post has unsized images.

[Unlighthouse](/cloud) scans your entire site and surfaces CLS issues across all pages. You'll see which templates have problems, which pages are outliers, and whether fixes work at scale.

The CLI is free and runs locally. Cloud adds scheduled monitoring to catch regressions automatically.
