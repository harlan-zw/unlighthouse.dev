Free API key setup in 2 minutes. No billing required for the free tier.

## Steps

### 1. Open Google Cloud Console

Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)

Sign in with any Google account. You don't need a paid Google Cloud account — the PSI API has a free tier.

### 2. Create or Select a Project

Click the project dropdown at the top of the page:

- **New users:** Click "New Project", give it a name like "PSI Testing", and create
- **Existing users:** Select an existing project or create a new one

### 3. Enable the PageSpeed Insights API

1. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Library** (or search "API Library" in the top search bar)
2. Search for **"PageSpeed Insights API"**
3. Click on it and press **Enable**

The API is now active for your project.

### 4. Create Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
2. Click **Create Credentials** → **API Key**
3. Copy the key that appears

Your key is ready to use immediately.

## Secure Your Key

API keys can be stolen and abused. A [CS student received a $55,444 bill](https://voice.lapaas.com/cs-student-google-cloud-bill-55444-api-key-leak-2025/) after their key was exposed on GitHub — attackers used it to call other billable GCP APIs. Always add restrictions.

### For Server-Side Use

Restrict by IP address:

1. Click on your API key in the Credentials list
2. Under **Application restrictions**, select **IP addresses**
3. Add your server's IP address(es)
4. Save

**Note:** IP restrictions [don't work with serverless platforms](https://vercel.com/kb/guide/can-i-get-a-fixed-ip-address) (Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda) since they use dynamic IPs. Use HTTP referrer restrictions or a server-side proxy instead.

### For Client-Side Use

Restrict by HTTP referrer:

1. Click on your API key in the Credentials list
2. Under **Application restrictions**, select **HTTP referrers**
3. Add your domain: `yourdomain.com/*`
4. Save

### API Restrictions (Critical)

**Always** limit the key to only the PSI API — this prevents the billing nightmare above:

1. Under **API restrictions**, select **Restrict key**
2. Choose **PageSpeed Insights API** from the dropdown
3. Save

## Test Your Key

Verify it works with a curl request:

```bash
curl "https://www.googleapis.com/pagespeedonline/v5/runPagespeed?url=https://example.com&key=YOUR_API_KEY"
```

A successful response returns JSON with Lighthouse data. An invalid key returns:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "API key not valid. Please pass a valid API key."
  }
}
```

## Quotas

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Requests per day | 25,000 |
| Requests per minute | ~240 |
| Requests per 100 seconds per user | 60 |

Monitor usage at **APIs & Services** → **PageSpeed Insights API** → **Quotas**.

The daily limit resets at midnight Pacific Time. Note: Google doesn't officially publish rate limits in their documentation. These values are from [third-party testing](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/pagespeed-insights-api) and [community reports](https://help.netpeaksoftware.com/en/support/solutions/articles/103000243641). Your actual limits may vary.

**Set up quota alerts:** Go to **IAM & Admin** → **Quotas & System Limits** → find PageSpeed Insights API → **Create usage alert** at 50%, 80%, and 95% thresholds.

**For higher limits:** Create multiple GCP projects (each gets its own 25k/day quota) or request a quota increase in the Quotas section. Google is reportedly reasonable about increases for legitimate use cases.
