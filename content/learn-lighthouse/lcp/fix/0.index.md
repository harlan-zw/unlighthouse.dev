# LCP Issues & Fixes

Not sure why your LCP is failing? This page covers every common cause with links to detailed fix guides.

The good news: most LCP issues come from a handful of causes. Find yours below and follow the fix guide.

## Diagnose Your Issue

Before jumping into fixes, identify exactly what's slowing down your LCP.

**Chrome DevTools (Quick Check):**
1. Open DevTools → **Performance** tab
2. Click the record button → reload page → stop recording
3. Find the **"LCP"** marker in the timeline
4. Hover to see which element and timing
5. Check the waterfall to see when resources load

**Lighthouse (Detailed):**
Run a Lighthouse audit in DevTools. Check:
- The LCP metric value and score
- **"Opportunities"** section for specific fixes
- **"Diagnostics"** section for underlying issues

**What to look for:**
- Is TTFB over 800ms? → Server response is the bottleneck
- Does the LCP image start downloading late? → Resource load delay
- Does LCP happen long after the image downloads? → Render-blocking resources
- Is the LCP element rendered by JavaScript? → Client-side rendering issue

## All LCP Causes

### High Impact

These cause the biggest LCP problems. Fix these first.

#### [Slow Server Response (TTFB)](/learn-lighthouse/lcp/fix/slow-server-response)

Time to First Byte is the #1 cause of poor LCP. Sites failing LCP have an [average TTFB of 2,270ms](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/performance)—that's almost the entire 2.5s mobile budget gone before the browser downloads anything.

If your TTFB is over 800ms, fix this before anything else. Caching, CDNs, and server optimization can cut TTFB by 50–80%.

#### [Render-Blocking Resources](/learn-lighthouse/lcp/fix/render-blocking-resources)

CSS and synchronous JavaScript prevent the browser from rendering content. Even if your LCP image downloads instantly, it can't display until render-blocking resources finish loading and parsing.

Look for large CSS files, external fonts, or sync scripts in `<head>`. Defer non-critical CSS and async load scripts.

#### [Redirects](/learn-lighthouse/lcp/fix/redirects)

Every redirect adds a full round-trip delay. HTTP→HTTPS, www→non-www, or marketing tracking redirects all stack up. A chain of 2-3 redirects can add 500ms–1s to your LCP.

Eliminate redirect chains. Update links to point directly to final URLs. Configure canonical URLs at the server level.

#### [Prioritize LCP Image](/learn-lighthouse/lcp/fix/prioritize-lcp-image)

The browser doesn't know which image is your LCP element until after the page renders. By default, it loads images in document order—which might mean your hero image loads after 50 other assets.

Use `fetchpriority="high"` on your LCP image. Add `<link rel="preload">` for images not in the initial HTML. This tells the browser to prioritize the right resource.

#### [LCP Lazy-Loaded](/learn-lighthouse/lcp/fix/lcp-lazy-loaded)

About [10% of LCP images are incorrectly lazy-loaded](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/performance). Lazy-loading delays the download until the image is near the viewport—but your LCP image is already in the viewport on page load.

Never lazy-load above-the-fold images. Remove `loading="lazy"` from LCP candidates. Use lazy-loading only for images below the fold.

### Medium Impact

These cause noticeable delays but are often secondary to the high-impact issues.

#### [Total Byte Weight](/learn-lighthouse/lcp/fix/total-byte-weight)

Pages over 3MB take longer to download and parse. Heavy JavaScript, unoptimized images, and large fonts all compete for bandwidth with your LCP resource.

Audit total page weight. Compress images, remove unused code, and consider lazy-loading non-critical resources. Target under 1.5MB for fast LCP.

#### [Unminified JavaScript](/learn-lighthouse/lcp/fix/unminified-javascript)

Unminified JS files are 20–30% larger than necessary. Larger files take longer to download and parse, delaying LCP if they're render-blocking.

Enable minification in your build process. Most bundlers (webpack, Vite, esbuild) do this automatically in production mode.

#### [Unused JavaScript](/learn-lighthouse/lcp/fix/unused-javascript)

The average page loads [30% more JavaScript than it actually uses](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/javascript). Unused code still downloads, parses, and compiles—wasting time that could go toward LCP.

Use code splitting to load only what each page needs. Tree-shake unused exports. Audit third-party scripts and remove what you don't need.

### Lower Impact (But Easy Wins)

These rarely cause LCP failures alone, but they're often quick to fix.

#### Large Unoptimized Images

[73% of mobile pages have an image as LCP](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/performance). Serving a 2MB hero image when a 100KB WebP would suffice wastes precious download time.

Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF), proper sizing (don't serve 4K to mobile), and compression. Image CDNs like Cloudinary or Imgix automate this.

#### Client-Side Rendering

When content only appears after JavaScript executes, LCP waits for JS to download, parse, execute, and render. This can add 1–3 seconds on slow connections.

Use SSR or SSG to send HTML with content. Hydrate the interactive parts afterward. Most meta-frameworks (Next, Nuxt, SvelteKit) support this.

## Decision Tree

Still not sure which cause applies? Work through this:

1. **Run Lighthouse.** What's the biggest opportunity listed?
2. **Check TTFB.** Is it over 800ms? → [Fix server response](/learn-lighthouse/lcp/fix/slow-server-response) first
3. **Find your LCP element.** Is it an image or text?
4. **If image:**
   - Is it lazy-loaded? → [Remove lazy-loading](/learn-lighthouse/lcp/fix/lcp-lazy-loaded)
   - Does it start downloading late? → [Add preload/priority](/learn-lighthouse/lcp/fix/prioritize-lcp-image)
   - Is it over 200KB? → Optimize the image
5. **If text:**
   - Is it rendered by JavaScript? → Add SSR/SSG
   - Are fonts blocking render? → Optimize font loading
6. **Check render-blocking.** Large CSS or sync scripts? → [Optimize delivery](/learn-lighthouse/lcp/fix/render-blocking-resources)
7. **Check redirects.** Any redirect chains? → [Eliminate them](/learn-lighthouse/lcp/fix/redirects)

## Framework-Specific Issues

Different frameworks have different common LCP problems:

| Framework | Most Common LCP Issues | Quick Fix |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Next.js** | Image component misconfiguration, App Router streaming delays | Use `priority` prop on LCP images |
| **Nuxt** | NuxtImage not configured, large payload hydration | Enable image optimization, reduce payload |
| **React** | Client-side rendering, large bundle size | Add SSR, code split aggressively |
| **Vue** | Async components blocking, SSR hydration mismatch | Preload critical components |
| **Svelte** | SvelteKit preload issues, image optimization | Use enhanced:img, configure preloads |
| **Angular** | Heavy initial bundle, Universal SSR setup | Use NgOptimizedImage, enable SSR |
| **WordPress** | Unoptimized images, plugin bloat, slow hosting | Use image optimization plugin, quality hosting |
| **Shopify** | Theme bloat, unoptimized product images | Use Shopify's image CDN, optimize theme |

→ See [framework-specific guides](/frameworks) for detailed walkthroughs.

## Test Every Page

Here's the problem with fixing LCP: your homepage might pass while product pages fail. Your blog index might be fast while individual posts are slow.

Testing one page at a time gives you a false sense of security.

[Unlighthouse](/cloud) scans every page on your site and surfaces LCP scores across all of them. You'll see which templates have issues, which pages are outliers, and whether your fixes actually work at scale.

The CLI is free and runs locally. Cloud adds scheduled monitoring to catch regressions automatically.
