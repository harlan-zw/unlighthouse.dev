The median site with poor LCP [spends 1.3 seconds on resource load delay](https://web.dev/blog/common-misconceptions-lcp)—time wasted before even starting to download the LCP image.

## What's the Problem?

Resource load delay is the time between when the browser receives the HTML and when it starts downloading the LCP resource. This happens when:

- The LCP image URL isn't in the initial HTML (e.g., set by JavaScript or CSS)
- Other resources are queued ahead of the LCP resource
- The browser doesn't know the image is important

**Why it hurts LCP:** Every millisecond spent waiting to *start* downloading is a millisecond added to LCP.

## How to Identify This Issue

### Chrome DevTools

1. Performance tab → record → reload
2. Find your LCP image in the Network section
3. Look at when the request starts vs. when HTML arrived
4. Large gap = resource load delay

### WebPageTest

Look at the waterfall chart. If the LCP image request starts late (far to the right), you have resource load delay.

## The Fix

### 1. Preload the LCP Image

Tell the browser to start downloading the LCP image immediately.

```html
<head>
  <!-- Preload LCP image -->
  <link
    rel="preload"
    href="/images/hero.webp"
    as="image"
    fetchpriority="high"
  >
</head>
```

For responsive images:

```html
<link
  rel="preload"
  as="image"
  href="/images/hero.webp"
  imagesrcset="/images/hero-400.webp 400w, /images/hero-800.webp 800w"
  imagesizes="100vw"
  fetchpriority="high"
>
```

### 2. Use fetchpriority="high"

Tell the browser this resource is critical.

```html
<img
  src="/images/hero.webp"
  fetchpriority="high"
  alt="Hero image"
>
```

The `fetchpriority` attribute has grown from [0.03% adoption in 2022 to 15% in 2024](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/performance).

### 3. Include LCP Resource in HTML

If your LCP image URL is set by JavaScript or CSS, move it to HTML.

```html
<!-- Before: image URL in CSS (discovered late) -->
<div class="hero" style="background-image: url(hero.webp)"></div>

<!-- After: image in HTML (discovered immediately) -->
<img src="hero.webp" class="hero" alt="Hero">
```

```jsx
// Before: image URL from JavaScript (discovered late)
useEffect(() => {
  setHeroImage('/hero.webp')
}, [])

// After: image in initial render
<img src="/hero.webp" alt="Hero" />
```

### 4. Avoid Lazy-Loading LCP

Never use `loading="lazy"` on your LCP image.

```html
<!-- Wrong: lazy-loading LCP image -->
<img src="hero.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Hero">

<!-- Correct: eager loading (default) with high priority -->
<img src="hero.webp" loading="eager" fetchpriority="high" alt="Hero">
```

About [10% of LCP images are incorrectly lazy-loaded](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/performance).

### 5. Reduce Request Chains

If your LCP resource depends on other resources loading first, eliminate the chain.

```html
<!-- Before: chain of dependencies -->
<!-- HTML → CSS → background-image URL → image download -->

<!-- After: direct preload -->
<link rel="preload" href="hero.webp" as="image" fetchpriority="high">
```

## Framework-Specific Solutions

::callout{icon="i-logos-nextjs-icon" to="/frameworks/nextjs/fix-lcp"}
**Next.js**

Use `priority` prop on `next/image`:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/hero.jpg"
  priority // Adds preload + fetchpriority
  alt="Hero"
/>
```

::

::callout{icon="i-logos-nuxt-icon" to="/frameworks/nuxt/fix-lcp"}
**Nuxt**

Use `preload` prop on `NuxtImg`:

```vue
<NuxtImg
  src="/hero.jpg"
  preload
  alt="Hero"
/>
```

Or use `useHead` for manual preload:

```ts
useHead({
  link: [{ rel: 'preload', href: '/hero.webp', as: 'image', fetchpriority: 'high' }]
})
```

## Verify the Fix

After implementing:

1. Check Network tab — LCP image should start downloading earlier
2. Run Lighthouse — look for preload suggestions
3. Compare LCP scores before/after

**Expected improvement:** Eliminating 1.3 seconds of resource load delay can improve LCP by 1.3 seconds.

## Common Mistakes

- **Preloading too many resources** — Only preload the most critical 2-3 resources. Too many preloads compete for bandwidth.
- **Wrong preload attributes** — Incorrect `as` attribute or missing `crossorigin` for fonts causes double downloads.
- **Preloading dynamic URLs** — If the image URL changes per page, use server-side rendering to set the correct preload.

## Test Your Entire Site

Resource load delay varies by page. [Unlighthouse](/) scans your entire site and identifies pages where LCP resources are discovered late.
