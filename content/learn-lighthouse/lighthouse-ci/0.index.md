# Lighthouse CI

Lighthouse CI (LHCI) is Google's official tool for running Lighthouse audits in continuous integration pipelines. It catches performance regressions before they reach production.

::note
**Current Version**: LHCI 0.15.x uses Lighthouse 12.6.1. The PWA category was [removed in Lighthouse 12](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/release_notes) (May 2024). Lighthouse 13 is not yet supported as it requires Node 22.19+.

## What is Lighthouse CI?

Lighthouse CI is a suite of tools that integrate Lighthouse into your CI/CD workflow:

- **@lhci/cli** — Command-line tool for running audits (~2M monthly npm downloads)
- **@lhci/server** — Optional server for storing historical data
- **GitHub App** — Status checks on pull requests

## Why Use Lighthouse CI?

[83% of Fortune 500 companies](https://katalon.com/resources-center/blog/ci-cd-pipeline-trends) have integrated automated performance testing into their CI/CD pipelines. Without it, regressions slip through:

1. Developer fixes performance issues
2. PR gets merged
3. Next week, someone adds a 500KB image
4. Performance tanks, nobody notices until users complain

LHCI solves this by running Lighthouse on every commit and failing builds that don't meet your standards.

## Key Features

- **Regression prevention** — Fail builds when [Core Web Vitals](/learn-lighthouse/core-web-vitals) like [LCP](/learn-lighthouse/lcp), [CLS](/learn-lighthouse/cls), and [TBT](/learn-lighthouse/tbt) (proxy for [INP](/learn-lighthouse/inp)) drop
- **Performance budgets** — Set thresholds for scores and resource sizes
- **Historical tracking** — Compare builds over time
- **Variance reduction** — Run multiple times, use median results
- **GitHub integration** — Status checks and PR comments

## Quick Start

Install and run:

```bash
npm install -g @lhci/cli
lhci autorun --collect.url=https://example.com --upload.target=temporary-public-storage
```

Or with a config file (`lighthouserc.js`):

```js
module.exports = {
  ci: {
    collect: {
      url: ['https://example.com/'],
    },
    upload: {
      target: 'temporary-public-storage',
    },
  },
}
```

Then run:

```bash
lhci autorun
```

## How It Works

The `lhci autorun` command executes three steps:

1. **collect** — Runs Lighthouse N times per URL
2. **assert** — Checks results against budgets/assertions
3. **upload** — Stores results (temporary storage, filesystem, or LHCI server)

Run `lhci healthcheck --fatal` separately to verify Chrome and config before autorun.

Results are saved to `.lighthouseci/` locally.

## What LHCI Measures

Lighthouse CI audits four categories on every run:

- **Performance** — [Core Web Vitals](/learn-lighthouse/core-web-vitals) ([LCP](/learn-lighthouse/lcp), [CLS](/learn-lighthouse/cls), [TBT](/learn-lighthouse/tbt) as proxy for [INP](/learn-lighthouse/inp)) and other speed metrics
- **Accessibility** — [Screen reader support, color contrast, ARIA](/learn-lighthouse/accessibility)
- **SEO** — [Meta tags, structured data, mobile-friendliness](/learn-lighthouse/seo)
- **Best Practices** — [HTTPS, console errors, deprecated APIs](/learn-lighthouse/best-practices)

Each category gets a 0-100 score. Set thresholds in your config to block merges when scores drop.

::note{type="info"}
**How scores map to percentiles**: A score of 50 means you're faster than 75% of sites. A score of 90 puts you in the [top 8% of all websites](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring). Currently, only [53% of origins pass all Core Web Vitals](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2025/performance).

## Performance Impact

Why invest in performance testing? Research shows direct business impact:

- [BBC loses 10% of users](https://www.hobo-web.co.uk/your-website-design-should-load-in-4-seconds/) for every additional second of load time
- [Amazon estimates](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/more/website-performance-conversion-rates/) every 100ms of latency costs 1% in sales
- [Google research](https://web.dev/learn/performance/why-speed-matters) shows bounce probability increases 90% as load time goes from 1s to 5s
